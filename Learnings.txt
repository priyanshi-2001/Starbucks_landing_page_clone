1. CSS
psuedo classes 
:root,:not,:empty
:root{//code} is similar to html{//code} but precedence of :root is higher
:not(p){color:blue;} will apply the propeties to all other tags except p tag
here we notice if html code is like:
<body>
<p>Hi!</p>
<h1>Carol!</h1>
</body>

so here what will happen is hi and carol will both be in blue color

Why?
because its inheriting from body tag
here except p tag are body and h1
ffrom body its coming to all elements of body

body :not(p){color:blue;} now this will change color of tags (other than p tag)  inside body tag so blue color is now only at h1 tag

CSS variables or custom properties 

advantage is that we can reuse them again in our code so its really easy to read and maintain

variables declared inside :root can be used anywhere 
variables declared inside particular class or tag name will be limited to use in that scope only
For accessing them we use var()
